    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The famous Wiener Schnitzel is by far the most well known dish of the austrian cuisine. When well prepared, it is very tasty and of high nutritional value. Even though it is typically prepared with veal, other types of meat like pork or chicken are also a great fit for the dish. Best served with slices of lemon and a potato salad as a side dish, the Wiener Schnitzel will never fail to meet the standards of even your most critical guests.</p>
